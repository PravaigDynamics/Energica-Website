              <p>A cookie is a small text file that a website places on your device — computer, smartphone, or tablet — when you visit it. Cookies allow the website to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you do not have to re-enter them whenever you return to the site or browse between pages.</p>
              <p>In addition to cookies, we may use similar technologies such as web beacons, pixel tags, and local storage to collect information about how you interact with our Site. This Policy covers all such technologies collectively referred to as "cookies".</p>

They are typically set in response to actions you take, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging into an account, or completing a form. Without these cookies, services you have requested — such as a test ride booking form — cannot be provided.</p>
              <p>These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. You can set your browser to block them, but this may prevent parts of the Site from working.</p>

              <h3>Performance & Analytics Cookies</h3>
              <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and measure traffic sources so we can analyse and improve the performance of our Site. They help us understand which pages are most popular, how visitors move through the Site, and where users arrive from. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and anonymised.</p>
              <p>We use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to collect this data. If you do not allow these cookies, we will be unable to monitor Site performance.

              <h3>Targeting & Marketing Cookies</h3>
              <p>These cookies are set through our Site by our advertising partners. They build a profile of your interests and display relevant advertisements on other sites you visit. They do not store directly identifiable personal information but work by uniquely identifying your browser and device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will receive less targeted advertising across the web.</p>
              <p>Advertising partners whose cookies may be set on this Site include Google, Meta (Facebook), LinkedIn, and others. These partners may use the data collected to serve ads on their platforms based on your interests.</p>
